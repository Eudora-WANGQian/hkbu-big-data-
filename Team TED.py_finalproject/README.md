# Brief Introduction:
On April 14, 2018, the US, Britain and France bombarded three government sites in Syria allegedly targeting the chemical weapons facilities. The Middle Eastern nation Syria has been in a state of civil war since last seven years with different groups trying to seize control of the country. The country has become an international battleground where various states and their proxy networks have been continuously clashing with each other. 

But is it true that Syria has been continuously suffering from its internal turbulence which need to be intervened by foreign players? 

For this project, we delved into the violations happened in Syria so as to have a general picture of the Syrian civil war and the major outside stakeholder behind this everlasting war, Russia.

# Data Analysis:

### Data Set:
- A media documentation: [Syrian Archive, a NGO group comprised of researchers, journalists, technologists and digital security experts]
(https://syrianarchive.org/en/database)<br>

- A recorded death list: [Violations Documentation Center in Syria, a network of Syrian opposition activists whose aim is to document human rights violations perpetrated since the beginning of the Syrian Civil War]
(http://www.vdc-sy.info/index.php/en/martyrs)<br>

### Data Volume:
- Syrian Archive: 3031
- Violations Documentation Center in Syria: 30,653

### Analysis Dimension:

- A general picture of the Syrian Civil War: 

a) What are the regions that most of the violations happened? Why major conflicts have been emerging in these places?
b) Is it true that chemical weapons have been frequently used in the war? What are the other major weapons involved?
c) Which sides are responsible for the deaths, the Syrian government, the opposition camps, or the Russian troops? Were most of the violations conducted against civilians or non-civilians?
d) What are the differences between the media documentation and the registered death list?

- The major outsider in the war: Russia

a) What are the cities that Russian troops have been actively fightin in? What makes them into major battlefields?
b) How closely Russia and Syria have been connected with each other, in terms of trade?

### Limitations and Weakness:
- Unable to track the trade transaction;
- Visualization is mainly based on Python though, we highly depend on Photoshop to better present the graphs.
