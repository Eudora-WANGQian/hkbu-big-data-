# OYO Dataset

The dataset contains the hotel information, including hotel names, locations, prices and ratings, in three northern Indian cities, Delhi, Jaipur and Agar, which are generally known as the "golden triangle cities" in terms of tourism spots. 

All data has been collected from OYO (https://www.oyorooms.com/), India's largest hospitality company, with the check-in time being June 1 when most Hong Kong universities are expected to end their academic semsters and students are free for travelling; while the length of stay has been set as one day, which will have no influnce in the liability of the data.
